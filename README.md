# Linked Lists

The first of three projects for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-linked-lists) Computer Science course.

## Description

In Computer Science, one of the most basic and fundamental data structures is the linked list, which functions similarly to an array. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements. In some programming languages, the size of an array is a concern and one of the ways to overcome that problem and allow dynamically allocated data is using linked lists.
